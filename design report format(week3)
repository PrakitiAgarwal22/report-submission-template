table of contents

1. authors(Table needed)

2. documentation
- details of the document(in a Table format)

3. document statistics
- word count,sentences etc...

4. workflow structure
- Gantt Chart, 
- WBS, 
- Critical Path and 
- Task Usage / resource (personwise resource) planning

5. abstract(some modification from previous report needed)

6. System Design Overview
write about how the entire system is designed. Things to add:

b. Overall System Schematic
c. Modularity of the system 
d. Choices and method of choosing 

7. Energy subteam contents
- *modified requirements*
- *modified specs*
- diagrams 
- brief description of working model ( keep it breif) 
- different options for flexibility based on cost and geographical limitations (Applicable for Solar and Energy Storage team)
- appendix for parts datasheet, vendor info
- references
**Remainder:-**(for energy Generation Subteams ) Donot add batteries, inverter
8. ***optional add-on***:- an interactive system where upon providing your budget and geographical details , it will give you a system configurated with the Parts, vendor information, and complete installation procedure (Diagrams) . 




Sub-Team Report Format:-

authors(Table needed)

workflow structure
- task allocation table(without heading row) for accountability and will also help in objectively rating members 

modified requirements
 
modified specs

diagrams(CAD, handdrawn etc..) 
- should contain:- a separate design of the machinery , and a diagram of installed system (till generation of electrcity)
***Less Text More Diagrams***
