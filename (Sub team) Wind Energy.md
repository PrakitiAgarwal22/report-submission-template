### Specifications


- **Nacelle**

     A nacelle is a cover housing that houses all of the generating components in a wind turbine, including the generator, gearbox, drive train, and brake assembly.Nacelle covers are often manufactured via resin-infused glass fiber composites to meet size, complex geometric and weight requirements. Nacelle covers are critical structural components that protect the turbine machinery against external hazards like precipitation, dust, UV radiation and lightning strikes.

| Blade Size  | upto 2.2 m |
| Usage/Application | Wind turbine system |

- **Rotor**

    Blades and hub together form the rotor. These are the most highly stressed and vital component of any wind turbine. Its job is to absorb the K.E. of wind and convert this energy into rotary motion around a central hub. The design of the turbines rotors is perhaps the most mathematical element of the entire turbine design. The rotors use aerodynamic lift to provide a turning moment and consequently an input torque to the gearbox. The hub acts as the mounting platform for the rotors to the drive shaft. The hub was designed using clamping force as the method for constraining the individual rotors in their desired position.

- **Generator**

     A generator converts the mechanical energy from the turning blades into electrical power for the use in domestic power. The type of generator most used in wind turbines are the permanent magnet synchronous generators. This is because in recent years, they have gained in attractiveness due to improving performance and decreasing cost. A Permanent Magnet Alternator is an electric generator which is used to convert mechanical energy to AC electrical energy. Wind turbines use permanent magnet alternators because of their inherent simplicity, dependability and consistent performance. A permanent magnet alternator is also light-weight, portable and less space-consuming, which is why they represent a very viable alternative to conventional generators.

- **Power Output**

     The energy produced by a wind turbine depends on a number of factors and is therefore very difficult to calculate accurately. It depends on the surrounding environment, the average wind speed in the region, air density of the region, type of terrain, elevation, etc. To get a rough estimate of power generated by the wind turbine, we need to know the available wind power and the efficiency of the turbine. 
      Available wind power (Pw) = 0.5 * ρ * v³ * A
                            where: 
                            A = Sweep area of turbine = π * r², where r is the size of the blade 
                            ρ = air density of the region
                            v = wind speed
    The actual output power of the wind turbine can then be calculated by multiplying the available wind power with the efficiency of the turbine. And according to Betz's law, **no turbine can capture more than 16/27** (59.3%) of the kinetic energy in wind. From various findings it is observed that the efficiency of a small wind turbine is typically in between 30-40%.
