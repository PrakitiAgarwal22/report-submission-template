### Specifications 
	
#### Wind



##### Brief Description

In our goal to design a system that meets the entire energy needs of a regular household, wind energy can be used to achieve self-sufficiency. It is one of the fastest-growing renewable technologies that utilize the energy of the winds by converting the kinetic energy produced by winds to electrical energy with the help of a turbine. Apart from being a renewable energy source, its operating cost is much lower than other resources. Wind energy is the future of power generation and the capacity to support the needs of the people.

##### Specifications

**Details of the system (Power generation and other specifications)** 

- **Nacelle**

A nacelle is a cover housing that houses all of the generating components in a wind turbine, including the generator, gearbox, drive train, and brake assembly.Nacelle covers are often manufactured via resin-infused glass fiber composites to meet size, complex geometric and weight requirements. Nacelle covers are critical structural components that protect the turbine machinery against external hazards like precipitation, dust, UV radiation and lightning strikes.

|:------------:|:-----------:|
| Body | Fibreglass and Carbon fibre |
| Blade Size  | upto 2.2 m |
| Usage/Application | Wind turbine system |
| Color | White |
| Surface finish | Gelcoat |


 - **Rotor**

Blades and hub together form the rotor. These are the most highly stressed and vital component of any wind turbine. Its job is to absorb the K.E. of wind and convert this energy into rotary motion around a central hub. The design of the turbines rotors is perhaps the most mathematical element of the entire turbine design. The rotors use aerodynamic lift to provide a turning moment and consequently an input torque to the gearbox. The hub acts as the mounting platform for the rotors to the drive shaft. The hub was designed using clamping force as the method for constraining the individual rotors in their desired position.

   |  |  |
     |:------------:|:-----------:|
     | Size of rotor | 3 m (in diameter) |
     | Material for formation of blades | Fibre-reinforced plastic |
     | Radius of blade | 1.4 m |
     | Area swept | 6.15 m^2 |
     | Material used for hub | Aluminium alloy |

- **Generator**

A generator converts the mechanical energy from the turning blades into electrical power for the use in domestic power. The type of generator most used in wind turbines are the permanent magnet synchronous generators. This is because in recent years, they have gained in attractiveness due to improving performance and decreasing cost. A Permanent Magnet Alternator is an electric generator which is used to convert mechanical energy to AC electrical energy. Wind turbines use permanent magnet alternators because of their inherent simplicity, dependability and consistent performance. A permanent magnet alternator is also light-weight, portable and less space-consuming, which is why they represent a very viable alternative to conventional generators.

- **Power Output**

The energy produced by a wind turbine depends on a number of factors and is therefore very difficult to calculate accurately. It depends on the surrounding environment, the average wind speed in the region, air density of the region, type of terrain, elevation, etc. To get a rough estimate of power generated by the wind turbine, we need to know the available wind power and the efficiency of the turbine. 
                                         Available wind power (Pw) = 0.5 * ρ * v³ * A
                                                               where: 
                                                               A = Sweep area of turbine = π * r², where r is the size of the blade 
                                                               ρ = air density of the region
                                                               v = wind speed
    The actual output power of the wind turbine can then be calculated by multiplying the available wind power with the efficiency of the turbine. And according to Betz's law, **no turbine can capture more than 16/27** (59.3%) of the kinetic energy in wind. From various findings it is observed that the efficiency of a small wind turbine is typically in between 30-40%. 
   
|                           |                              |
|:-------------------------:|:----------------------------:|
| Turbine type              | Horizontal-axis wind turbine |
| Blade length              | 1.4 m                        |
| Wind speed                | < 5 m/s                      |
| Density of air            | 1.23 kg/m³                   |
| Available wind power (Pw) | ~540 W                       |
| Turbine efficiency        | 40%                          |
| Output power              | ~210 W                       |




**Utilization of energy in home appliances and related specifications**
 
 From the above specifiactions and calculations, we can see why it is challenging to harness wind energy in regions of Northen India where annual average wind speed is not much higher. Though we can ramp up the energy output by using a higher tower and more effective machinery but the increase in the electricity generated is not in sync with the increase in the cost required to install and maintain the wind turbine. 
       
For our model, the energy ouput without losses is approximately 200 W which is not much very good for a regular household usage as per its cost. Still, if we choose to install the turbine, it can power some small appliances of our household, charge our laptop/phone, light a bulb, etc. But we should keep in mind that this works only until the nature favours us and the wind speed is good enough for electricity generation.

#### Hydroelectricity

##### Brief Description

Hydro-electricity can be used to attain our objective to design a system that meets the whole energy needs of a typical household. Around 17% of the world’s electricity needs are fulfilled by hydro-electric energy, which is   expected to increase by about 3.1% each year. It is a renewable energy technology harnessing the power of the collected water of a reservoir by transforming potential energy into kinetic energy then into electrical energy via a turbine with almost no pollution. It is also a flexible source of power as the quantity of electricity produced by it may be changed up or down extremely quickly (as little as a few seconds) to react to changing energy demands.

##### Specifications

**Details of the system (Power generation and other specifications)**

- **Turbine**

  The water turbine is the heart of any hydropower plant. It consists of a number of metal or plastic blades fitted to a central rotating shaft or plate. Water flowing through the casing strikes the blades of the turbine producing torque and making the shaft rotate thus conversing K.E. for water to M.E.

  |                     |             |
  | :-----------------: | :---------: |
  | Material of Turbine |  Cast Iron  |
  |     Blade Size      |   0.13 m    |
  |   Water Flow Rate   | 0.03 m^3^/s |
  |     Head Height     | 2 m to 4 m  |
  |       Weight        |    10 kg    |

- **Generator**

  Generators are used to convert rotational energy to electrical energy. The type of generator used here is the permanent magnet synchronous generator. This motor generates a single-phase AC output that needs to be converted to DC using a rectifier.

  |               |                    |
  | :-----------: | :----------------: |
  |     Model     |     BGWG-500WM     |
  |     Power     |        500W        |
  | Rated Voltage |       220 V        |
  |     Phase     |    Single Phase    |
  |  Rated Speed  | 500 rpm - 1500 rpm |
  |  Net Weight   |        15kg        |

- **AC-DC Converter**

    As the generator gives AC output so to convert AC to DC for charging an AC-DC converter is used.

  |                |           |
  | :------------: | :-------: |
  |     Model      | NPS-500 W |
  |  Rated Power   |   500 W   |
  | Output Voltage |   24 V    |
  |  Max. Current  |   28 A    |

- **Power Output**

    The maximum hydropower power output is entirely dependent on how much head and flow is available at the site. The formula for power calculation is derived from the concept of stored potential energy in water at a certain height H(Head Height) and given by the formula:
    Power (P) = m _ g _ H~net~ \* η
    where:
    m is the mass flow rate(kg/s)
    g is 9.81m/s^2^
    H~net~ is the effective height of stored water
    η is overall efficiency
    Most of the Hydro-Electric systems used for domestic purposes have η about 75%.

  |                  |            |
  | :--------------: | :--------: |
  |   Turbine type   | Axial Flow |
  | Water Flow Rate  |  30 kg/s   |
  |   Head Height    |   2.2 m    |
  | Plant Efficiency |    75 %    |
  |   Output power   |   ~485 W   |



**Utilization of energy in home appliances and related specifications**

By above mentioned specifications and power output calculations, we can conclude that this system can help us run basic electric home appliances like television, fridge, mobile chargers etc. Also we can increase the power output by suitably choosing the location to get high flow rate like Northern indian water-bodies have high flow rate. Thus, by suitably choosing the above mentioned devices we can increase the efficiency and can get higher electricity generation.


**Cost Analysis**

  |          Part           |  Cost   |
  | :---------------------: | :-----: |
  | Generator - Turbine Set | ₹18,500 |
  |     AC-DC Converter     | ₹3,500  |
  |   Pipes and Fittings    | ₹2,000  |
  |   Construction Works    | ₹2,000  |
  |        **Total**        | ₹26,000 |
