### Abstract

We are generating electricity from the heat produced by household devices like television, cooking stove by using  Thermoelectric Generators (TEGs), which are based on the phenomenon of Seebeck effect. The TEG systems will be installed at places in the  house where heat is generated. The TEG system contains two dissimilar thermoelectric materials joined at ends which acquire temperature gradient at ends upon application of heat and thereby, electrons flow towards cooler side. On connecting the joined ends to a battery through charge controller, we charge the battery which can be further utilized as an electricity source.

### Specifications

#### Details of the equipment (Power generation and other specifications)

Power Generation : We have the following information for a [TEG](https://www.electronicscomp.com/sp1848-27145-thermoelectric-power-generator-teg-150-degree-c-peltier-module?gclid=EAIaIQobChMImonqn6Kp9QIV0pJmAh0f5A92EAQYASABEgLc6_D_BwE) which has size 40 x 40 x 3.6 mm^3, and costs Rs. 215.

| 	Temperature	 (C)  |Open Circuit Voltage (V)|Current (mA)	|
|---------------------|------------------------|----------------|
|20                   | 0.97                   | 225            |
|40                   | 1.8                    | 368            |
|60                   | 2.4                    | 469            |
|80                   | 3.6                    | 558            |
|100                  | 4.8                    | 669            |

- Assuming the temp. difference to be 40 C, P = 1.8 x 0.368 = 0.6624 W. This is the power of this single TEG.
- We can place multiple TEGs at places in our house where heat is generated:

|        Place                             | 		No. of TEGs	 |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Kitchen Stove (assuming 2 burners)       | 16                  |
| For using Body heat (using jackets)      | 4                   |
| Electrical devices (TV's, Refrigerator)  | 10                  |
| Heat from the sun                        | 10                  |

- Electricity from cooking : When we cook for 90 minutes, we can generate a current of nearly 16 x 0.368 A = 5.888 A throughout. This is enough to charge a 4.5 AH battery in under an hour.

#### What can be used by the power generated?

Here is the power consumption of typical household appliances: [Power Consumption](https://letsavelectricity.com/wattage-power-consumption-of-household-appliances/). Thus, the power generated can be utilized in several ways:

-   A Led bulb consumes around 7W-10W of power, thus electricity generated from Electrical devices heat, or the heat of the sun can be used to light led bulb. 

-   An average phone charger consumes around 4W-5W, thus heat from our body can be used for phone charger .
    
-   A low power small table fan consumes around 10-15W of power, thus a Kitchen stove heat can be used to generate the power sufficient for table fan. 

-   An Extractor / Exhaust Fan uses around 10-12 W of power; thus, a Kitchen stove heat can be used to generate the power for exhaust fan. 
    
-   Apart from these things, the power generated from the above waste heat can be used to charge lots of other chargeable devices such as Clock Radio, smart devices such as Amazon Echo and other smart chargeable devices which usually consume less power to charge.


#### Cost Analysis

Installation cost: It is around Rs 250 for each piece, so using around 40 TEGs in the house would cost us Rs 10,000. 

Running and Maintenance Cost: The device can bear a maximum temp. of 150˚ C, and thus can be used inside the houses, without a danger of damage. The device can up-to work 200,000 hours (around 22-23 years). 

Hence, it is like a one time installment which will work for years.
