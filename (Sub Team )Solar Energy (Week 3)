#Modified Requirements
**Basic Requirements**

1. It should be optimally programmed to capture energy from the sun efficiently.
2. The roof top must contain atleast 200 sq. ft area well enough exposed to direct sunlight to generate 2.5kW.
3. The entire home solar power system should be interconnected with adequate and appropriate cabling and wiring to channelize the energy into a usable form.

**Apparatus Requirements**

1. **Photovoltaic Panels** : Photovoltaic cells convert solar energy into electricity. This component requires the most space, with the quantity and size of panels proportional to the building's energy demand.
2. **Inverter**: The inverter converts the panels' Direct Current (DC) power into usable Alternating Current (AC) for usage in the building. Depending on the predicted electricity load, inverters come in a variety of capacities.
3. **Battery**: The battery stores the electricity generated by the panels during daylight hours for use at night or whenever no power is generated. The size of the battery varies and is usually determined by the night load.
4. **Charge Controller**: A charge controller (also known as a charge regulator) is a device that regulates the voltage and current flowing from solar panels to batteries. The major purpose of a charge controller is to prevent overcharging of batteries (which might harm the battery) via solar panels, as 12V solar panels deliver 17-20V when there is no load or full sunlight. The reason for this image is that manufacturers design solar panels for different climates and environments so that you get the maximum rated voltage even when there is cloud cover, poor sunlight, and strong haze, among other things.
5. **Active Solar Tracker**: Active trackers use drivers, which are motors linked to sensors reacting to light from the sun or following GPS coordinates of its position. Some tracker models have separate, smaller PV panels specifically to power the driving system.

 **Cost Analysis**

- Installing cost
   Cost 6 Bluebird 395 Watt Solar Panels = ₹ 6*14,250 = ₹ 85,500/-
   Cost of HAVELLS HRFR PVC 4 sq/mm Yellow 90 m Wire = ₹4,351/-
   Cost of 3 Solar Panel Mounting Structure = ₹ 3*2,261= ₹6,783/-
   Cost of Solar Tracker = ₹6000/-
   
   
   Total Installation cost = ₹85500+₹4,351+₹6783+₹6000 = ₹102634
   
- Maintenance Cost
  Negligible Maintence cost because we have to just clean the solar panels

# Brief Description of Working Model
- So firstly, solar energy falls on the solar panels. We make sure that solar panels are at the best angles for maximum exposure to the sunlight through an *Active Solar Tracker*.This device's sensors react with sunlight and angle the solar panels through drivers and motors accordingly. 
- These solar panels are mounted on the roof with the help of mounting structures and they allow them to maintain and change their position according to the position of the sun.
- These solar panels are made up of solar (or photovoltaic) cells that can be used to generate power via the photovoltaic effect. On the surface of solar panels, these cells are organised in a grid-like arrangement. As a result, it can alternatively be described as a collection of photovoltaic modules put on a supporting framework. A photovoltaic (PV) module is a 610 solar cell packaged and linked assembly.
- After light strikes these photovoltaic cells they convert that kinetic energy of photons is absorbed by the electrons inside the material and they come out on the surface if this absorbed energy is greater than their work function.
  These electrons also possess some kinetic energy and this energy can be converted into electric potential energy. This effect is called the photoelectric effect and it is the working principle for these solar panels.
- This electric current generated is then transferred to the inverter through cables and wires and then it is stored in the batteries. This energy is then first converted to AC current through inverters and then is distributed in the house for usage.
