It is highly important that we decide what are the things we want to write in sub team reports.

We should decide the contents that must be present in the different sections.


1. Requirements (This will be the first section in a sub team report)

What all things should be written under this section.

-> Geographical requirements
-> what else?
->



2. Specifications

-> Components
-> Power generation (what all can the system power)
  -> What is Peak Power
  -> What is Average Power over energy source duration ?
  -> What is the amount of units of energy ( units == kWhr) expected to be produced ?
  -> What is the mode through which your system will output energy ( DONOT INCLUDE STORAGE)
-> Cost analysis
## Remove chargers from your reports, energy storage team will handle it
## but send which charger you wawnt to use to the energy storage  team


3. Diagrams and Working

-> Working principle
-> Actual implementation
## Add updated geographical specifications too in your reports
