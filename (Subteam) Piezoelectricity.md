### Abstract

```
Our goal is to design an optimised system to harvest energy via Piezoelectricity using direct piezoelectric effect. Piezoelectric crystals and ceramics can be utilized to obtain voltages of very small values and hence can drive low voltage devices or build self powered devices. Hence, piezoelectric energy harvesting comes under the category of micro scale energy harvesting scheme.
