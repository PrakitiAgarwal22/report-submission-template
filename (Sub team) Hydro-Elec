### Description

    Hydro-electricity can be used to attain our objective to design a system that meets the whole energy needs of a typical household. Around 17% of the world’s electricity needs are fulfilled by hydro-electric energy, which is expected to increase by about 3.1% each year. It is a renewable energy technology harnessing the power of the collected water of a reservoir by transforming potential energy into kinetic energy then into electrical energy via a turbine with almost no pollution. It is also a flexible source of power as the quantity of electricity produced by it may be changed up or down extremely quickly (as little as a few seconds) to react to changing energy demands.

### Specifications

- **Components**

  - **Turbine**

  The water turbine is the heart of any hydropower plant. It consists of a number of metal or plastic blades fitted to a central rotating shaft or plate. Water flowing through the casing strikes the blades of the turbine producing torque and making the shaft rotate thus conversing K.E. for water to M.E.

  |                     |             |
  | :-----------------: | :---------: |
  | Material of Turbine |  Cast Iron  |
  |     Blade Size      |   0.13 m    |
  |   Water Flow Rate   | 0.03 m^3^/s |
  |     Head Height     | 2 m to 4 m  |
  |       Weight        |    10 kg    |

  - **Generator**

  Generators are used to convert rotational energy to electrical energy. The type of generator used here is the permanent magnet synchronous generator. This motor generates a single-phase AC output that needs to be converted to DC using a rectifier.

  |               |                    |
  | :-----------: | :----------------: |
  |     Model     |     BGWG-500WM     |
  |     Power     |        500W        |
  | Rated Voltage |       220 V        |
  |     Phase     |    Single Phase    |
  |  Rated Speed  | 500 rpm - 1500 rpm |
  |  Net Weight   |        15kg        |

  - **AC-DC Converter**

    As the generator gives AC output so to convert AC to DC for charging an AC-DC converter is used.

  |                |           |
  | :------------: | :-------: |
  |     Model      | NPS-500 W |
  |  Rated Power   |   500 W   |
  | Output Voltage |   24 V    |
  |  Max. Current  |   28 A    |

  - **Power Output**

    The maximum hydropower power output is entirely dependent on how much head and flow is available at the site. The formula for power calculation is derived from the concept of stored potential energy in water at a certain height H(Head Height) and given by the formula:
    Power (P) = m _ g _ H~net~ \* η
    where:
    m is the mass flow rate(kg/s)
    g is 9.81m/s^2^
    H~net~ is the effective height of stored water
    η is overall efficiency
    Most of the Hydro-Electric systems used for domestic purposes have η about 75%.

  | :--------------: | :--------: |
  |   Turbine type   | Axial Flow |
  | Water Flow Rate  |  30 kg/s   |
  |   Head Height    |   2.2 m    |
  | Plant Efficiency |    75 %    |
  |   Output power   |   ~485 W   |

- **Total Installation Cost**

  |          Part           |  Cost   |
  | :---------------------: | :-----: |
  | Generator - Turbine Set | ₹18,500 |
  |     AC-DC Converter     | ₹3,500  |
  |   Pipes and Fittings    | ₹2,000  |
  |   Construction Works    | ₹2,000  |
  |        **Total**        | ₹26,000 |

- **Conclusion**
  By above mentioned specifications and power output calculations, we can conclude that this system can help us run basic electric home appliances like television, fridge, mobile chargers etc. Also we can increase the power output by suitably choosing the location to get high flow rate like Northern indian water-bodies have high flow rate. Thus, by suitably choosing the above mentioned devices we can increase the efficiency and can get higher electricity generation.
